<main class="main">Egypt's Supreme God
  <p>Many religious gods protected Egypt. Amun merged with the supreme Egyptian god Ra to form Amun-Ra. This made religion very powerful, gave the priest influence and some political control, and took influence away from the Pharoah. Akhenaten went against fifteen centuries of religious tradition, removed the gods' names from temple walls, and destroyed their statues. His father, Amenhotep had built many of the most beautiful temples with statues made of precious stones. Amenhotep began these changes by making himself a king and a god. Pharaohs before him were viewed as god-like but not as gods. They were the head of their religious cult and were the high priests. Amenhotep changed this. Akhenaten went further than his father, replaced the animal gods with humans, and got rid of the warrior Pharaohs. 
     He showed the Pharoah as an individual with a family who is loved by the Sun god.</p>

<aside class="sidebar">The Builders

  <p>Amenhotep and his son Akhenaten built the most beautiful temples and presented the finest statues and visual imagery to the Egyptians. Pharaohs portrayed themselves as war heroes and conquerors. Their images are carved into temple walls with bright colors. He built over one thousand statues of himself. Building great temples gave the people the impression that he was god and could not be resisted. Akhenaten changed the way temples were built by using smaller blocks and building them more quickly, giving the impression that he was even greater than his father.</p>
